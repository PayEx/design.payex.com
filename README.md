[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/u04ft9aha1uwiex4/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/erikhallaraaker/design-payex-com/branch/master)

## Installing / Getting started

The installation guides in this file is for further development of the DesignGuide, and is not necessary if you plan to use the DesignGuide in your project.

### Prerequisites

DesignGuide requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (includes npm).

### Installing

1. Open a terminal and navigate to repo root
1. `npm install`
1. `npm start`
    * If encountering an error, you might need to install [webpack-dev-server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server) globally. You can do this by running the command `npm i webpack-dev-server -g`.
1. Go to <http://localhost:3000>
1. Works? If not, contact us on Slack ([#design-guide-general](https://payex.slack.com/messages/C0L3W8B2S/)).
1. Get codin'

## Developing

### Built with

* [React 16.3](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Less 2.7](http://lesscss.org/)

### Setting up Dev

* Running the command `npm start` starts the webpack dev server, (which is configured in `./webpack.config.js`). If any changes is made to this file, or any files directly influencing this file (i.e. any loaders or plugins) you need to restart the server.
* The script `npm start` will set the *NODE_ENV* variable to __development__, and start the dev server in development mode. If you wish to run the dev server in production-like environment run the command `npm run start:prod`.

#### Importing components

When importing different components in the files you create, you can use shortcuts for common paths. The shortcuts are as following:

* `~` - root of the project (example `import package from "~/package";`).
* `$` - `./src`-folder (example `import px from "$/px-script";`).
* `@` - `./src/App/components`-folder (example `import Alert from "@/Alert";`).
* `#` - `./src/App/Documentation/utils`-folder (example `import { DocToc } from "#";`).

The shortcuts are specified in the `./.babelrc`-file. Specifying the prefix-shortcuts in the `./jsconfig.json`-file enables path intellisense for the shortcuts (at least in VSCode).

### Building

To start building, run the command `npm run build` to start in dev-mode, or `npm run build:prod` for production-mode. This will make webpack start bundling everything and make static files in the `./dist/`-folder. It will also run through all files in `./src/` with eslint making sure all files are without errors before building. Also make sure all tests pass, or make changes to them accordingly.
> Note: This will delete all files already located in `./dist`.

## Versioning

Design Guide uses [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/). This means that internally, Design Guide will use a `major.minor.patch` version number to signal what the changes in each release surmount to. Since `minor` and `patch` version increments means backwards compatibility will be upheld, only the `major` version number will be a part of the URL of CSS and JavaScript files. This also means both CSS and JavaScript files are versioned in lockstep, so whenever a new `major` version of the CSS is released, a new `major` version of the JavaScript will be as well.

## Tests

1. Open a terminal and navigate to repo root
1. Run the command `npm test`
    * Many of the tests are snapshot based, and runs against already created snapshots. If you need to update the snapshots due to changes run the command `npm run test:update`.
    * A test coverage report is generated after running the tests. This can be found in `./coverage`.
> Note: Snapshot testing is pretty unforgiving, so if you make __ANY__ changes to how a component is rendered, which already has a snapshot, the tests __WILL__ crash! So make sure to run `npm run test:update` before committing.

## Code style

Coding style rules set in `./.eslintrc` & `./.stylelintrc`.

__*Make sure to follow the syntax rules enforced by eslint & stylelint.*__
